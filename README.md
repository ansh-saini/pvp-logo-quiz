5. Clone this repository
6. Create a copy of `.env.example` file. Rename it to `.env` and fill out the variables. You can find values for `APPWRITE_ENDPOINT, APPWRITE_PROJECT` on the Appwrite dashboard itself. `APPWRITE_SERVER_API_KEY` is the server API key secret that we generated. Rest of the variables will be generated by the setup script.

7. Run `yarn setup`. It will create the required collectoins and provide you with their unique IDs. Add them to your `.env` file. It will also add some logos to your database so you can get up and running instantly.
8. That's it. You can now run `yarn dev` and start playing.
